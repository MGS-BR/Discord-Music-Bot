# Discord-Music-Bot
Music bot for discord with everything working 09/16/21

You can use these files to make a music bot for your Discord server

# How to configure:

It's pretty simple, you just need to open the 'config.json' file and in the code location where it says **"token":"TOKEN HERE"** you replace the **TOKEN HERE** with your bot's token.

Now if you did everything correctly just run main.py and have fun with the bot!
